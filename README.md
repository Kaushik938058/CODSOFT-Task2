Project Title: Tic-Tac-Toe AI Agent

Domain: Artificial Intelligence

OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Objective:

The main goal of this project is to build an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human . The AI is designed to be unbeatable, meaning it will either win the game or force a draw, but never lose .

Technical Implementation:

The project utilizes the Minimax algorithm, a recursive search algorithm used in decision theory and game theory .

Minimax Logic: The algorithm evaluates all possible future moves in the game tree. It assigns a value to each end state (+1 for AI win, -1 for Human win, 0 for Draw) and chooses the move that maximizes the AI's score while minimizing the human's potential score.

Game Theory: This implementation demonstrates the concept of a zero-sum game, where one player's advantage is the other's disadvantage .

Search Algorithms: It serves as a practical example of basic search algorithms navigating through a problem space .

Key Features:

Unbeatable Strategy: The AI anticipates the human player's optimal moves and blocks them.

Interactive Gameplay: A command-line interface allows the user to input moves (0-8) and view the board state.

State Evaluation: The system automatically checks for wins, losses, or draws after every turn.

Technologies Used
Language: Python

Libraries: math (Standard library used for infinity values in the algorithm)
